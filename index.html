  <img src="/images/biopic.jpg" alt="Photo of Mariana" class="aboutpic">
  <p class="abouttxt">I'm Mariana, and photography and film have been a central part of my life since I was teenager.
I'm originally from Colombia and moved to the states shortly after receiving my Bachelors in Fine Arts. There I worked as an Au Pair with the main focus on learning English. I also enjoyed traveling around the country, experiencing American culture, and meeting new friends. Just as my time there was coming to an end I met the love of my life, a year later we ended up getting married and had a beautiful boy.
Photography and Film has been passion of mine since I was little and I couldn't imagine any other career. I specialize in Wedding, Maternity and Portraits, as well as Lifestyle and Product photography. 
For me, photography is a way of documenting the world and capturing history, even in moments that might seem small and insignificant on the surface.
I always spend time getting to know my clients before we work together. I want to make sure that I know you and your goals and wishes, so I can deliver exactly the result you want and need.
I provide professional photography services to clients in the DMV area, and other nearby areas. To find out more about how we can work together, <a href=".pages/contact.html">get in touch.</a></p>
