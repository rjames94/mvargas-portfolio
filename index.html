    <div class="abouttxt">
      <p>I'm Mariana, and photography and film have been a central part of my life since I was teenager.</p>
      <p>I'm originally from Colombia and moved to the states shortly after receiving my Bachelors in Fine Arts. There I
        worked as an Au Pair with the main focus on learning English. I also enjoyed traveling around the country,
        experiencing American culture, and meeting new friends. Just as my time there was coming to an end I met the
        love
        of my life, a year later we ended up getting married and had a beautiful boy.</p>
      <p>Photography and Film has been passion of mine since I was little and I couldn't imagine any other career. I
        specialize in Wedding, Maternity and Portraits, as well as Lifestyle and Product photography.</p>
      <p>For me, photography is a way of documenting the world and capturing history, even in moments that might seem
        small
        and insignificant on the surface.</p>
      <p>I always spend time getting to know my clients before we work together. I want to make sure that I know you and
        your goals and wishes, so I can deliver exactly the result you want and need.</p>
      <P>I provide professional photography services to clients in the DMV area, and other nearby areas. To find out
        more
        about how we can work together, <a href="contact.html">get in touch.</a></p>
